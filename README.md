# Data-Engineer-Excersize
Faisal Musa Data Engineering Interview 

The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your level of skill when it comes to manipulating and aggregating a large dataset through code. We’ll evaluate the quality, output and readability of your code as well as the efficacy of provided documentation.
We recommend using Python and Pandas to complete this exercise. Most of our production data engineering work is done using Python, Pandas and PySpark (a “big data” alternative to Pandas).
We recommend submitting your code by way of a personal GitHub repository. Directly submitting code files is also acceptable.
Draft documentation describing how a reviewer can run your app locally. Be sure to include steps like installing dependencies or other “pre-flight” configurations necessary for your code to run.


How to run both tasks:

Install Python (version 3.7 or higher) on your local machine.
Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Clone the repository using the command: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the cloned repository using the command: cd <repository-name>/task1
Install the required dependencies by running the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script by executing the command: python task1.py
